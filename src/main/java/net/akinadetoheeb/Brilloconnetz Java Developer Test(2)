                           Brilloconnetz Java Developer Test(2)

2: Create a console-based program that allows the shopkeeper to make pancakes, and the 3 users
   can eat the pancakes simultaneously. A single user can eat maximum 5 pancakes within 30 seconds.
   Also, the shopkeeper can make a maximum of 12 pancakes every 30 seconds. The system should
   decide the number of pancakes that each of the 3 users want to eat in the 30 second’s period; but
   cannot exceed the maximum 5 pancakes rule (A simple way to decide the numbers of pancakes is to
   generate them randomly). The code could output the following.
•  starting time of the 30 seconds slots,
•  the ending time of the 30 seconds slots
•  number of pancakes made by the shop keeper, number of pancakes eaten by the 3 users
•  whether the shopkeeper was able to meet the needs of the 3 users or not
•  how many pancakes got wasted if any.
•  If the shopkeeper was not able to meet the needs of all the customers, how many pancake orders were not met.
   Provide a non-concurrent and concurrent (Note, do not use Threads, or ExecutorServices) Java
   program to solve this. Compare and contrast both versions of the code and state your observations.
