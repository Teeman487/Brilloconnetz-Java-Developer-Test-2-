                               Explanation and Observation of Concurrency Version

i.  Threads or ExecutorServices was not used. Pancake-making by the Shopkeeper and consumption process by the Users  were
    simulated for each 30-second slot.
ii. In the concurrent version, we removed the array for pancakesEaten by Users since each user's pancake consumption is
    independent and doesn't require an array to store their consumption. This simplifies the code and better represents
    the non-concurrent nature of the problem.
iii. The concurrent version simplifies the code by handling each user's consumption separately.
iv.  The concurrent version is more efficient and cleaner
