                               Explanation and Observation of Concurrency Version

i.  Threads or ExecutorServices was not used. Pancake-making by the Shopkeeper and consumption process by the Users  were
    simulated for each 30-second slot.
ii. Each user's pancake-eating task is represented by a CompletableFuture. The main loop waits for all user tasks to
    complete using CompletableFuture.allOf, the results are then combined to calculate the total pancakes eaten and
    other results shown in the code.
iii. The concurrent version simplifies the code by handling each user's consumption separately.
iv.  The concurrent version is more efficient and cleaner
